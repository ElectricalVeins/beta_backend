## TODO:

- add tier to jwt token. Introduce tiers to logic. critical priority.
- add frontend. critical for app. high priority.
- add __*pre-select*__ typeorm hook. (Problem - no hooks available in lib. **Find a solution**). high priority. Need for validation tier value presence on every query.

## Deferred:

- add swagger specs. not critical - no public api present currently.
- add request header validation on tier. no need - simply extract tier from jwt token
